- when changing or adding an activity, the home page sorting won't be updated until it is visited for a second time.
- notifications do not alert at the exact minute (could be a simple dumb DateTime.now() sort of fix).
- notifications sometimes are not cancelled or updated when either or the activity is updated.
- REMINDER PARAMETERS are really screwed up

In order of priority / projected time until implementation is finished: 
1. add more home layout views
    - e.g. by day, by weighted order
2. add the ability to filter activities by parameter or type
3. modify the floating action menu to expand to a grid of all activity types and remove the (now) reduntant "new" button in the app bar
4. add SMS and email reminders (will require an alarm manager of sorts (hopefully easier to integrate than current solutions)
5. add location and relevant people support
6. allow ability to change the time parameter that notifications are based off
7. more intuitive navigation and data entry.
8. allow for remote data backup with firebase
9. improve local storage method (needs major efficiency improvement)
